# Prediction of Covid-19 Cases Using Machine Learning

It is a Python code to predict the future Covid-19 cases by using confirmed cases and confirmed death cases from Sept-Dec 2020.
Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression have been chosen with train test split 7:3 and degree of polynomial = 4.

1. LR show better accuracy than PR which is 68% for confirmed cases.
2. PR show better accuracy for death cases with 63%.
3. For Malaysian data, PR accuracy achieve 88% while LR is 75%.
4. Death cases in Malaysia show 32% and 28% respectively for PR and LR.
